Update guide for Unity Developers
In this update, code-created haptics were changed. The following classes were renamed:

CodeEffect -> HapticEffect
CodeSequence -> HapticSequence
CodePattern -> HapticPattern


Additionally, the Sequence, Pattern, and Experience classes were removed. If your code depends on these,
you should change any instance of them into their respective Haptic-X equivalent. To load the asset,
use HapticSequence.LoadFromAsset("directory/name_of_asset")

This change means that assets must now be imported into unity using the Tools/Hardlight Window -> Package Importer GUI. 


You can now combine file-defined haptics with code-defined haptics, because they are the same thing:

HapticSequence heartbeat = new HapticSequence();
heartbeat.LoadFromAsset("Haptics/my_heartbeat");
HapticPattern scared = new HapticPattern();
scared.AddSequence(0.0, AreaFlag.Chest_Left, heartbeat);
scared.AddSequence(1.0, AreaFlag.Chest_Left, heartbeat);
scared.Play();
