Update guide for Unity Developers
In this update, code-created haptics were changed. The following classes were renamed:

CodeEffect -> HapticEffect
CodeSequence -> HapticSequence
CodePattern -> HapticPattern

Additionally, the Sequence, Pattern, and Experience classes were removed. If your code depends on these,
you should change any instance of them into their respective Haptic-X equivalent. To load the asset,
use HapticSequence.LoadFromAsset("name_of_asset")  This change
allows you to combine any file-defined haptic with code-defined haptics at runtime. 

For example, you can now do this:

HapticSequence heartbeat;
heartbeat.LoadFromAsset("Haptics/my_heartbeat");
HapticPattern scared = new HapticPattern();
scared.AddSequence(0.0, AreaFlag.Chest_Left, heartbeat);
scared.Play();

	- Is responsible for taking raw haptic assets (.sequence, .pattern, .experience) and creating
