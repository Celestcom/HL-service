Chimera SDK v0.1.4
-------------------
Service = v0.1.2
Plugin = v0.3.0
Unity SDK = v0.1.4


Update guide for Unity Developers
In this update, code-created haptics were changed. The following classes were renamed:

CodeEffect -> HapticEffect
CodeSequence -> HapticSequence
CodePattern -> HapticPattern

Additionally, the Sequence, Pattern, and Experience classes were removed. If your code depends on these,
you should change any instance of them into their respective Haptic-X equivalent. To load the asset,
use HapticResources.LoadSequence("name_of_asset") or HapticResources.LoadPattern("name_of_asset"). This change
allows you to combine any file-defined haptic with code-defined haptics at runtime. 

For example, you can now do this:

HapticSequence heartbeat = HapticResources.LoadSequence("Haptics/my_heartbeat");
HapticPattern scared = new HapticPattern();
scared.AddSequence(0.0, AreaFlag.Chest_Left, heartbeat);
scared.Play();


Release Notes
------------------------
Service
	- Many bugfixes and stability changes
Plugin 
	- File-loading features have been removed, and relocated to the HapticAssetTools executable. 
	- PollStatus now detects if the service is not running
Unity SDK
	- Change CodeHaptics API:
		- Now renamed to HapticEffect, HapticSequence, HapticPattern
		- Created dynamically in code or by loaded from an asset
HapticAssetTool
	- Is responsible for taking raw haptic assets (.sequence, .pattern, .experience) and creating 
	a HapticDefinitionFile. This is a simple json/protobuff format which completely specifies a haptic effect. 
	The json format can be imported into Unity and loaded as an asset.
